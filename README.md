# Enigma
Testing the NSA's Enigma machine implementation.

## Description 
This project is focused on unit testing and measuring code coverage for a simulated Enigma machine.  To learn a bit about the history of this 
machine and how it works, I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcX7iO_XCFA). 
 
 
The original code for the Enigma machine is from [this github repository](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/enigma-simulator) published by the NSA (with some small 
changes and a bug fix).  The repository was lacking tests, so I wrote some of my own in `test_enigma.py`.
